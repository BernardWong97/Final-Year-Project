# Final Year Project 

## Introduction
This is a repository for my final year project.  
Project's goal is to learn machine learning and how to deploy the model onto a web application.

## Context
The purpose of this application is to show how a machine can learn from datasets and recognise vehicles that are passing by the road
 while gathering and analysing data.  

## Programming Languages and Frameworks
- Python
- Flask
- TensorFlow Keras

## Models
- [Resnet50-COCO](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5)
- [YOLO](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/yolo.h5)
- [YOLO-TINY](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/yolo-tiny.h5)
