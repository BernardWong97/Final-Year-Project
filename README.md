# Final Year Project 

## Introduction
This is a repository for my final year project.  
Project's goal is to learn machine learning and how to deploy the model onto a web application.

## Context
The purpose of this application is to show how a machine can learn from datasets and recognise vehicles that are passing by the road
 while gathering and analysing data.  

## Programming Languages and Frameworks
- Python
- Flask
- TensorFlow Keras
